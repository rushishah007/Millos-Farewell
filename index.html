					so many great memories together. I remember the IEEE orientation and Pratishtha too, and it was so much fun to see you and everyone else there working together. And thank you for remembering the suit and saree day in which you told me that to remove the googles and then will click photo, that was a lot of fun too! I'm glad we all enjoyed our IV trip, cake cutting when we had our 1st paper published, picking
					you up at night for aarya’s birthday and blowing the balloons and decorating the car, You and rane once came to my home for Ganpati will be always remembered. And of course, the creativity work and the night out with Rushi were both unforgettable and many more but still I always hope we would have met earlier.</p>

Whenever you walk into any room you light up the entire environment and bring a smile to everyone's face (at least mine). I can describe these past 15 months as the best time that I have had.

					You have turned out to be one of my most important best friends in my life. Someone, who I may not have spent all my time in these four years with but everytime we got together it was the perfect and most truest girl time I've ever had. Through all the drama, friends who have come and gone you've been by my side and I know USC will give you a new life away from us (even though I'll be there in four months to haunt you). I love you 3000, and i cant wait make more core memories with you while eating all the best food a picky eater like you can gorge on.</p>

Believe it or not, I'll always look for someone like you in all my future friends. I'm grateful that we became such good friends, and I just wanna thank you that. Praying for USC and LA because, trust me, they're not ready for this cute goblin. I'll miss you a lot and can't wait to meet you again (very soon)!</p>

				  <p style="font-size: small;">Dear Milloni,

					How are you? I hope your are fine.Today, you are leaving for the USA, and though I'm happy for you, I can't help but feel a bit sad. Teri kami humesha khalne wali hai college mai!
					
					The first time I saw you was that Calci workshop from that day my respect towards has always grown exponentially. You are true gem for this college and also for everyone in this group.
					Those NAAC days were truly special and unforgettable for me. The college was empty, and everyone in college was just enjoying those moments knowing that it would never repeat again. It was first time I met you and uff teri itni badi bag , tu koi doremon se kam nahi thi.
					Everything we needed was there with you may it be scissors, stapler, food ya phir knowledge or skills.
					
					Tere sath last year ke yuva se lekar kya hi enjoy kiya hai , Tera bday celebrate karna last year ka kya hi achha tha. And then you came like a savior for my last year mini project uff. Always thankful for that.
					
					And how can I forget this year's creativity time? Tere bina iss saal ka creativity complete hi nahi hota.Tune kaafi help kiya and legit thank you for that. That whole LED stuffs kya hi difficult tha , but you were super optimistic on that too. 
					
					Milloni, you've been more than a senior to me. You've been a friend, a mentor, and a guide for almost 2 years now. Your support and guidance have always been a source of strength for us.
					
					I wish you to stay more here , but i guess this is it now. 
					I wish you all the best on this new journey. May you find success, happiness, and all the adventures you've ever dreamed of. Stay safe in US and keep in touch.
					
					With love and warm wishes,
					
					[Yours Og apsara partner]</p>

					It’s hard to believe that we have known each other for almost 8 years now :) 
					Kind off tough to pick and choose my favourite memories since all of them are just so equally wonderful! 
					I still remember the first time you sat next to me in 8th grade and honestly I experienced love at first sight! XD 
					I cracked a dumb joke to diffuse the awkwardness and you cackled so atrociously, it was hilarious!
					I still crack a smile when I think about how you talked me into scaring that rikshawalla after that tuition Halloween party 😭. Actually I still remember you promising me that you will treat me to a domino’s pizza and I’m still waiting for that day to come! 😡
					Anyway, from surviving those sleep inducing Priya miss ka tuitions to Los Fucking Angeles, you’ve come a very long way, and I’m super duper proud of you, girl!
					I’m really hoping we get to experience Japan together someday! 
					Can’t wait for you to be my sugar mamma for real HAHAHHAHA
					I’m looking forward to our virtual dates! :P 
					Love you so much, Millu!</p>

					<br>
					This journey will be "kabhi Khushi, kabhi gham" but always remember to be brave and give it your all "jab Tak hai jaan"! Kabhi low feel ho toh yaad rakhna "Bade bade deshon mein aisi chhoti chhoti baatein hoti rehti hai" and "Mai hoon na" toh "You'll be alright". Also make sure to experience things as if "Zindagi na milegi dobara". Lekin agar aapko "Koi mil Gaya" toh bhul mat jana "Hum aapke hai kon". Whenever we meet here and if I don't drink, you know why 😂 "Agar mai pee lu aur tum mere nashe mai hone ka faayda nai uthaogi, toh peene ka kya faayda" 😂 This is your time to shine and hence "Ja Millo ja, jee le apni zindagi". Ha and "Zindagi mein agar kuch banna ho, kuch haasil karna ho, kuch jeetna ho, toh hamesha dil ki suno." Lastly "Tumhari smile kitni dangerous hai pata hai? ... mere paas dil hota na, teri smile pe pakka aa jaata"
					 Ps: aa gaya hai
					 <br>  Millo se baat, millo se baat jab bhi man ho karlo, millo se baat! Aisa mauka jabhi mile, saare bache khush ho jaate! Millo se baat, millo se baat, jabhi chance ho karloooooo<br>
					 I have to admit "Mujhe yaad sataye teri, Haaye haaye yaad sataye teri".  Millo mere sher, mere cheeteh, tujhe 1 saal akela kya choda, tune itna bada jhol kar diya? Koi na, aaja ab jaldi, intezaar rahega 🫶🏻
